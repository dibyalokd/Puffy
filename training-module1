Here is the concise breakdown of Module 1, keeping each explanation to a maximum of two lines:
Module 1: AI Fundamentals
 * The Big Picture: AI vs. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning
   AI is the broad goal of making machines smart, ML is the method of learning from data, and Deep Learning is the advanced tech mimicking brain structures.
   
 * Terminology: Algorithms, Models, Training, and Inference
   An algorithm is the "recipe," the model is the "trained chef," and inference is the "chef" actually cooking (generating) an answer for you.
 * Types of AI: Narrow AI vs. General AI (AGI)
   Narrow AI is a specialist (like Spotify or Siri) that does one task well, while General AI (AGI) is a theoretical machine that can do anything a human can.
 * Real-world Context: History and Current Industry Impact
   AI has evolved from simple "if-then" rules to massive systems that now automate complex tasks, reshape job roles, and speed up global innovation.
 * Capabilities: What AI Can Realistically Do vs. What It Cannot
   AI excels at pattern recognition, summarization, and speed, but it lacks true human empathy, common sense, and original moral reasoning.
