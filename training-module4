This module is where the theory ends and the actual "work" begins. It’s designed to show your team exactly where AI fits into their 9-to-5.
Module 4: Practical Workplace Workflows
 * Productivity Hacks: Meeting Notes, Email Management, and Brainstorming
   Use AI "notetakers" to instantly convert meeting audio into action items and leverage LLMs to draft complex email replies or brainstorm project ideas.

   Upload messy spreadsheets to AI tools to identify trends, clean formatting errors, and generate charts without writing a single Excel formula.
 * Tool Selection: Finding the Right AI Tool for Specific Department Tasks
   Learn which tool to use when—selecting "specialists" for image generation, "generalists" for writing, and "analyzers" for research or technical data.
 * The "Human-in-the-Loop" Model: Reviewing and Editing AI Output
   Adopt a strict policy where AI does the "heavy lifting" (the first 80%), but a human provides the final 20% of expert review and factual verification.
