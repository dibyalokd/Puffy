Moving to the engine room—here is the two-line breakdown for Module 2.
Module 2: Generative AI & LLMs
 * The Core Tech: Large Language Models (LLMs) Explained
   LLMs are massive AI systems trained on trillions of words to understand, summarize, and generate human-like text at scale.
 * The Process: Tokens, Context Windows, and "Super-powered Autocomplete"
   AI breaks text into "tokens" (chunks of characters) and predicts the next most likely token to build sentences, much like a highly advanced autocomplete.
 * Model Landscape: Text (GPT/Gemini), Image (Midjourney), and Video
   Generative AI isn't just for chat; different specialized models can now create high-quality art, realistic videos, and even original music from simple prompts.
 * Technical Flaws: Hallucinations and Factual Errors
   Because AI predicts the next word based on probability rather than facts, it can sometimes confidently invent "fake news" or non-existent citations.
