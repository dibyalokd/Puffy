This final module is perhaps the most critical for protecting the organization. It ensures that while the team becomes more productive, they don't inadvertently create legal or security risks.
Module 5: Ethics, Safety & Policy
 * Data Privacy: Handling Sensitive Company and Client Information
   Never input proprietary code, financial records, or private client data into public AI tools, as this information can potentially be used to train future models.
 * Bias & Fairness: Identifying Prejudices in AI Results
   AI can mirror historical biases found in its training data; always audit outputs for unfair stereotypes or exclusionary language before publishing.
 * Copyright & Legal: Ownership of AI-Generated Content
   Purely AI-generated work often cannot be copyrighted; legal protection usually requires "significant human authorship" through original editing and refinement.
 * Company Policy: Guidelines for Responsible Internal Use
   Follow the official "AI Rulebook" regarding which tools are approved for work, how to disclose AI use, and the mandatory human-in-the-loop review process.
You're all set! You now have a complete, 5-module foundational course structure. To help you launch this with your team, would you like me to draft a 1-page "AI Code of Conduct" memo that summarizes these safety points for them to sign?
