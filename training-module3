This is the "make or break" module for your team. It’s where they move from being casual users to power users.
Module 3: Mastery of Prompt Engineering
 * Prompt Frameworks: Role, Context, Task, and Constraints
   Give the AI a persona (Role), background info (Context), a clear goal (Task), and boundaries like word count or tone (Constraints).
 * Techniques: Zero-shot, Few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought Prompting
   Learn to ask directly (Zero-shot), provide examples (Few-shot), or ask the AI to "think step-by-step" (Chain-of-Thought) for complex logic.
 * Iterative Design: Refining Outputs Through Multi-turn Conversation
   Treat the AI like an intern; if the first result is off, don't restart—give feedback and ask for specific adjustments until it's perfect.
 * Workplace Automation: Summarization, Drafting, and Data Formatting
   Apply these techniques to turn messy meeting transcripts into clean action items, draft personalized emails, or convert text into professional tables.
